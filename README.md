# Toylang
Toy language created in  Rust for educational purposes.

Has if statements, scopes, variables and exit.
Nothing more so no uncessesary bloat.

# Description
This implementation lacks an intermediate representation, so it is only able to compile on x86-64 assembly code. I'd like to implement an IR someday but as it is, the language won't compile correctlyif you are not using windows x86-64 and have nasm and ld linked installed on your machine.
