# Modified Automatic Refernce Counting (MARC)
So I've decided that I might use a slightly modified version of refernce counting for this project.
It's supposed to be completely automatic and the programmer doesn't need to think about the memory.
Sounds too good to be true? probably it is because I still haven't figured it all out.
